💡 Learnings & Challenges: 

This project had highs and lows.
HTML and CSS were smooth, but JavaScript — especially collisions and classes — was challenging.

The biggest learning was starting a project from scratch, structuring the code, and thinking like a developer.

If I had more time, I would add more features and polish the gameplay even further.


🌱 Future Improvements: 

More levels or increasing difficulty

Power-ups

Mobile controls

High score system

More animations and visual effects
